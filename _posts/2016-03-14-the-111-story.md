We were born to be a part of the Story written by a Father for His only begotten Son whom displayed His love for all humanity. It is a story of the nations and The King who desire their hearts and love. Throughout human history, many gave themselves completely to the will of our Father and the glory of King Jesus. They lived their lives worthy of all that Jesus had done for us - by giving up everything to gain Everything. The only reason why we have the knowledge of Him today because many laid down their lives for the Gospel of the Kingdom to flourish in my world. 

He is inviting us to be a part of His Story, to take this gospel of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth as a testimony of Christ to the nations and the end shall come.

description: "\"I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation\" (Romans 15:20) The Apostle Paul was driven by an ambition to preach the Gospel, a strong desire to bring the truth about Jesus to those who had not heard of His name and His fame."

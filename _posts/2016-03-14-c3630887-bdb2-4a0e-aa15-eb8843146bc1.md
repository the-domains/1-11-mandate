The one big question I always had during my teenage years and my mid-twenties was "How do I be 'on fire' for God"? If we can articulate what this means or how it actually looks like, we would be able to set the compass in our lives to let this passion burn consistently from the days of our youth till the day we become grey-headed.

As a young boy, my desire has always been wanting to live passionately and be on fire for Jesus. I grew up hearing stories of man and woman who gave their lives to missions and their testimonies of all the great exploits. My youth leaders inspired us with stories of revival and 3rd heaven experiences. With those longing to experience I went on to read up on my own biographies of men and women who left a mark in Church history. My heart was apprehended by what they did and their produce, which later formed my understanding of being 'on fire' for God is all about the exploits, experiences and the external. It is something that I must do for God that will make me become on fire for Him. The effort of trying to stay on fire for Jesus came to an end as the years of doing caused me to burn-out instead of burning.

Reading stories of these men and women of God is a good thing because it inspires us. What we don't realize is when we read or hear about their lives, those were moments of their public victory that was won in their private life. In those 500 pages of exploits recorded by man, in-between those pages were 500,000 pages of mundane decisions they have made in the secret for God; where no man could witness and only the angels of heaven have the record in God's Book.

In the words of Mike Bickle, 

_"Radical Christianity is staying faithful for decades." _

I have come to realize being radical and on fire for God is not about doing something extreme for a moment, but to be consistent in our daily living and the little choices that we make for love. There will be seasons for the big and grand, but most part of our lives is made up of the little things and the mundane. It is when we are faithful over a little that God will set us over much.

I believe these men and women whom we are deeply inspired by didn't just live in the fantasy of the moment, but they lived in the consistency of a movement in the secret. I believe these men and women gave time to stand before God in the secret more than standing before man in the public. I believe these man and woman could do exploits in public because they have learnt to witness God's exploits in the secret. 

I believe these men and women have learnt to be faithful in positioning themselves to be found by God in the secret; who so happen to be the All Consuming Fire Who burns with deep desire for them which also is the reason of them being known as a man on fire. 

The zeal, passion and desire of man can only go a short distance because our strength is finite, but the zeal, passion and desire that God possesses remains for all eternity because His strength is Infinite. 

After 14 years of my journey with God, I have found my answer to a life on fire as well as the secret of these men and women who left a legacy whose life inspired the generations;

_The secret to a life 'on fire' is to be found in the secret with the God on Fire. _

_I don't just want to live for God, but I desire to live from Him.._

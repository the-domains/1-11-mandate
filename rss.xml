            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>People of the Cross</h1><p>ISIS calls Christians "the people of the Cross." I think Jesus did too. ISIS means it as a term of humiliation. I think Jesus did too. ISIS, and Muslims in general, believe that it's crazy that we think Jesus would have died on a cross.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/24166048b653446312bffa1265b593e0e0a08fa9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

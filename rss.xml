            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Should the Church Study Eschatology?</h1><p>Eschatology, which is the study of the end times, can be one of the more controversial topics in the church and unfortunately that causes some believers to nearly entirely neglect the study of this subject and the key passages related to it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f2826a8212c8376da37457c08c392a4786c0b4cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Becoming a Voice</h1><p>In my experience every twenty-year-old thinks the world revolves around him or her, and it's not something you can just shake them out of. It takes time. It takes pruning, rebuking, and, like John the Baptist, years spent in a wilderness.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/97a7148f946cd13d83940c7f91d3ba3b8ba4ff53.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>People of the Cross</h1><p>ISIS calls Christians "the people of the Cross." I think Jesus did too. ISIS means it as a term of humiliation.
